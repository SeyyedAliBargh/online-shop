    ðŸ”” Signal: pre_save for Product model

    This function runs automatically **before** a Product instance is saved.

    Purpose:
        - Automatically calculate the `discount_price` field
          based on `original_price` and `discount` percentage.

    Behavior:
        - If a discount exists, it calculates the discounted price.
        - If the discount is missing, the discounted price equals the original price.
        - If invalid or non-numeric data is provided, it safely falls back to the original price.
